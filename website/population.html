                This graph represents a very basic thing: Amount of members in the sub. The number is not random; it
                is fixed by Moscamye. During the first weeks, the population increased drastically, but to retain the
                sensation of a small village, this has stopped in recent weeks.
                <br>
                <br>
                The blue line represents the limit between newcomers (above the line) and dwellers (below the line).
                This means that, for example, in week 3, there where 70 people of which 15 were already part of the sub
                and 55 were new. The dashed line is a reference line that indicates half of the population at the time.
                Note how similar the blue line is to the one in the retention graph. They are, in essence, representing
                the same thing.
                <br>
                <br>
                Note 1: If you look close enough, you might find something out of place: weeks 26 and weeks 35 have
                151 (and not 150), and 161 (not 160) people. The case of week 26 is documented in
                <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheConfluence/comments/ik4e8s/rumours_of_wehooper4s_death_were_greatly/">
                    this post
                </a> about u/wehooper4's "death" (leaving the sub). There was a mistake and they were removed from
                the group. People were picked for the next week to get a total of 150, and then wehooper had to be
                reincorporated, giving a total of 151 people. Now on week 35 what happened was something I call
                "out of protocol" incorporations. This is not the first time that happens, but basically, Moscamye
                adds people who were part of the sub and want back in after leaving. They are added out of the regular
                schedule, and this can mess up the beatiful round numbers. However, it's up to me to decide whether
                they are part of this week's fold or the following one. For historic examples I just made them go in the
                following one. But for the case of Ishotagrapefruit7, I decided to incorporate them to the previous one.
                Other cases are: Aurallius, Tim19678, Grognak_the_Orc. These members possess the special sloth flair.

                Note 2: "But wait a second, what's going on in week 5, wasn't there more than 50% retention?". That's a
                great question. You see, the blue line looks a lot like retention, but it is not. Retention is a ratio
                between the people who stayed divided by the total amount of people from LAST week. In terms of this
                graph, retention would be people below the blue line divided by people above the blue line IN THE
                PREVIOUS week. That's why the blue line does not quite reach the dashed one.
