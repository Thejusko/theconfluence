                This graph shows the proportion of times and days of the week when users are active in the subreddit.
                It is unfortunate that it is not very easy to go further back in time than 1000 posts with PRAW. This means
                the data analysed is not from the beginning of The Confluence. Actually, far from it. I will update this every some
                months or so (doesn't update automatically).
                <br>
                EDIT: I have worked around the issue of 1000 posts by looking for older ones through the profile pages
                of users. Many of these accounts are deleted or suspended, so some posts are bound to be lost. But I believe
                the great majority of posts have been found.
                <br>
                Note the increased activity during Tuesdays/Wednesdays (and earlier Sundays/Mondays), when new runs start and new members are added.

                For reference, this is when midnight hits in some timezones (in GMT):
                <br>
                North American Central Time (CST) = 06:00
                <br>
                Brasilia Central Time = 3:00
                <br>
                European Central Time (CET) = 23:00
                <br>
                Arabian Standard Time = 21:00
                <br>
                China Standard Time (CST) = 16:00
                <br>
                Australian Central Standard Time (ACST) = 14:30
