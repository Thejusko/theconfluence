                Retention is how much people that were part of the community at a given week stayed in the following
                one. Since total amount of users is a changing number, it is meaningful to represent this number as
                a percentage of the total, instead of the simple amount of people.

                There is a notable upwards trend, which makes sense, since you can think of people as sediments going
                through a river. Most of them flow away, but some stay. Maybe for good, maybe for a while. But the key
                is that after some time, the sediments start accumulating and become something bigger. If given
                enough time, they can create a delta or a small island, and this becomes a solid community.
