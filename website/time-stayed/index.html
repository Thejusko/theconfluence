            This graph represents something simple: How many people stayed how many weeks. Of course, the great
            majority of them stayed only one week, because they did not participate at all. But one important thing
            to note is that the amount people that stayed two weeks has a similar characteristic, given that
            on some weeks there was no run, meaning that users that did not participate at all got a free extra
            week for nothing. <br><br>
            Because we can't really see what's going on with the first graph, the second one shows only people that
            stayed 3 weeks minimum.
