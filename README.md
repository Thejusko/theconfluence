# theconfluence website

Website: https://zokalyx.github.io/theconfluence/

Upcoming features: 

Search by flair number and see all of the people who have had that flair (Not sure about this one. Is not very interesting, maybe only top 10 or so).

Mega video condensing all of the history of the sub into a single animated chart made with manim. Might have to use p5 if the video turns out to be too large :/
Plus image version.

Add images and other info to users. Maybe.

Various graphs/charts about many statistics made with manim or matplotlib.

(If requested) "About" section where I explain technical details.

Add some explanations for special weeks (and special users maybe, like sloths).

Oldest post of each user.

Page for links to all of the posts about runs.

TODO:

Fix to be more exact the timer that indicates "Data will be updated soon".
