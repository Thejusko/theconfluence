Furfty was accidentally marked as removed from the sub in departures 44.
All numbers above 83 in arrivals (all) have to be manually increased by one.

A bug is causing trouble when decreasing population (181 > 180 in week 45) due 
to Furfty's mistake. I'll delete Elle181 out of the system (sorry!) until I
make a proper solution. Who knows when :p. UPDATE: I'll keep Elle181 in
and they'll appear for one week more than they should have.
UPDATE 2: I added a placeholder because graph looked weird.

I have replaced Or-Your-Money-Back with yo-whatupmofo
